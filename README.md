# CollegeCourseWork

The files in this folder are the cumulative course work completed during my time at
Texas A&M Commerce and Richland Community College.


## CSCI 430 Introduction to Operating Systems

This file contains four programs written in C++.

This course was the follow up to Machine Language and taught the basics of Operating Systems.


One program from this course is seperate labeled GaryFowlerCSCI430Program5.


## CSCI 270 Data Structures

This file contains four programs written in C++.

This course taught binary search, trees, linked lists, and other important data structures.


## CSCI 333 Java Language Programming

This file is titled JavaClassCoursework.

This file also hosts Programming Fundamentals II Coursework.

Texas A&M University Commerce focused on C++ and so I took this course as an elective.

The professor took our knowledge of Object Oriented Design and taught the fundamentals of the Java
Language, how to incorporate our knowledge into this language, the major differences between the two
languages, and some advanced Object Orient Programming.


## PHYS 319 Computational Physics

This file is titled PythonCourseWork.

There are multiple files in here holding multiple scripts each.

This course was another elective, it taught the Python programming language and how physicists use the language
on a daily basis.

The files are stored as ipynb extensions, which are ipython notebooks we used the Jupyter program to access these
and Spyder as a IED.


## MATH 401 Essentials of Statistics

This course was the required stats course, it is included here to show knowledge of the R language.

We used R Studio to do the coding, the files are R Notebooks.


## CSCI 428 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

These files are titled GaryFowler_Program3Starcraft and
gary_fowler_AutomobileClass_CSCI428

This course taught Object Oriented Design principals and focused on Inheritance.

There are only 2 programs written in C++, one homework the other the final project.
